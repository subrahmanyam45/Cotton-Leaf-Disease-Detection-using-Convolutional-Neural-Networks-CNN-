									 Water-soaked spots on leaves which are delimited by leaf veins, 
									 giving them an angular appearance; lesions increase in size
									 and turn black and necrotic; leaves drop from the plant; 
									 disease may also cause elongated gray-black lesions extending 
									 from the leaves to petioles and stem which are known as the "blackarm"
									  phase; severe blackarm symptoms may cause the stem to be girdled; 
									  water-soaked lesions may be present on bolls; boll lesions enlarge 
									  and become sunken and brown-black in color.
